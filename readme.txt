This plugin can add several messages or adverts to the bottom of every WordPress post and page and now messages can be shown in in Home, Category & Archives summary pages. You can select which post or page displays the messages.

== Description ==

Please Deactivate and Delete previous version before installing this version. This plugin allows you to add more than one message at the bottom of your WordPress post or page. You can have as many messages as you need as there is no limit to how many messages you have at the bottom of your post or page. Examples of messages are Google Authorship and Copyright notice, Googles Ads from AdSense, Facebook + Google+ and Twitter Like and Share buttons, and even other affiliate adverts like advertisements from Commission Junction, ClickBank and other affiliate programs and even Sign Up forms. The plugin is SEO sensitive by allowing or diasbling a message to be part of the webpage SEO. You can show post messages in Home, Category & Archives summary pages. Can process and display shortcodes.

With version 1.05 you can disable some pages or post from displaying messages.

As of version 1.19 shortcodes can now be displayed through the messages.

My thanks to Cynthia K. Wunsch, http://www.striketherightnote.com, for requesting me to allow the posts to be shown in Home, Category & Archives summary pages.
My thanks to Scott Million, http://www.apartmentforrentinsaigon.com, for requesting me for some pages and some post not to display messages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin can add one or more messages or advertisements to the bottom of every post and every page. You can have different content for your posts and pages. With version 1.01 you can set the message to be saved outside the webpage so that it does not affect your SEO tuning of the webpage.

= How can I edit the message? =

In your WordPress Control Panel, go to menu option Settings > dpaBottomofPostPageMenu and you will see several options and settings. The first is the number of messages you want displayed at the bottom of every post and every page. They can be a different number of messages for posts and for pages. Set this figure to at least 1 and click Submit button if you want something displayed.  

Then click on radio buttons to display messages in Posts and or Pages and save by clicking on Set Display button.

You will see one or more text areas appear in the POST section and in the PAGE section depending on the figures you entered. Select whether the message you add in here "AFFECTS SEO" or "DOES NOT AFFECT SEO". If it AFFECTS SEO then specify the dimensions of the message in pixels. Do remember that Facebook, Google, Twitter, ... like buttons should be part of your page so they should be marked as "DOES NOT AFFECT SEO".

Fill the message text areas with your HTML code then click on Save Post Messages button or Save Page Message button to save. 

After this go back and select the "Display or Dont Display" options and then click on the "Set Display" button to save the settings. If you had selected "Dont Display" for either posts or pages then those will not be displayed. 

You are done. View your webpages and you will see those messages at the bottom of every post or page.

= Where can I see the change? =
