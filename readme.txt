== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin can add one or more messages or advertisements to the bottom of every post and every page. You can have different content for your posts and pages. With version 1.01 you can set the message to be saved outside the webpage so that it does not affect your SEO tuning of the webpage.

= How can I edit the message? =

In your WordPress Control Panel, go to menu option Settings > dpaBottomofPostPageMenu and you will see several options and settings. The first is the number of messages you want displayed at the bottom of every post and every page. They can be a different number of messages for posts and for pages. Set this figure to at least 1 and click Submit button if you want something displayed.  

Then click on radio buttons to display messages in Posts and or Pages and save by clicking on Set Display button.

You will see one or more text areas appear in the POST section and in the PAGE section depending on the figures you entered. Select whether the message you add in here "AFFECTS SEO" or "DOES NOT AFFECT SEO". If it AFFECTS SEO then specify the dimensions of the message in pixels. 

Fill the message text areas with your HTML code then click on Save Post Messages button or Save Page Message button to save. 

After this go back and select the "Display or Dont Display" options and then click on the "Set Display" button to save the settings. If you had selected "Dont Display" for either posts or pages then those will not be displayed. 

You are done. View your webpages and you will see those messages at the bottom of every post or page.

= Where can I see the change? =

When you view the posts or pages.

== Changelog ==

Version 1.01 

1. Any messages that might affect your SEO can be saved elsewhere and not on your webpage. 


2. All file names and sub-directory names were changed to lower case so that it will be more compatible with all servers. Due to the filename changes to lower case, if you have problems when you upgrade, then delete Version 1.00 first and then reinstall version 1.01. Do save, copy and paste into a text file, all your messages before deleting the plugin.
