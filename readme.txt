= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin can add one or more messages or advertisements to the bottom of every post and every page. You can have different content for your posts and pages. 

= How can I edit the message? =

In your WordPress Control Panel, go to menu option Settings > dpaBottomofPostPageMenu and you will see several options and settings. The first is the number of messages you want displayed at the bottom of every post and pages. They can be a different number of messages for posts and for pages. Set this figure to at least 1 and click Submit button if you want something displayed.  You will see one or more text areas appear in the POST section and in the PAGE section depending on the figures you entered. Fill these text areas with your HTML code then click on Save Post Messages button or Save Page Message button to save. After this go back and select the "Display or Don’t Display" options and then click on the "Set Display" button to save the settings. If you had selected "Don’t Display" for either posts or pages then those will not be displayed. You are done. View your webpages and you will see those messages at the bottom of every post or page.
